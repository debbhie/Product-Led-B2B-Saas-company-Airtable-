# Product-Led-B2B-Saas-company-Airtable

# Overview
This project simulates a B2B SaaS operating analytics environment built entirely in Airtable.
The system centralizes product usage, subscription revenue, and customer support activity to enable real-time monitoring of business performance.
The objective is to transform raw operational records into:
* Decision-ready KPIs
* Automated workflows
* Executive dashboards
The solution demonstrates how a modern SaaS company can run product, revenue, and support intelligence without a traditional data warehouse.
